# The Basics of Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language known for its
flexibility and wide applicability in addition to its accessibility to new
programmers. This is a short description of some key features of Python as they
relate to this project. It is hardly comprehensive, however; if you'd like to
learn more about this language and how to use it, I suggest taking a look at the
[official beginner's guide][1] or this [series of recorded lectures from an MIT
course][2].

## 0. Structure of a Python program
The fundamental goal of any programming language is to describe a well-ordered
list of explicit actions for a computer to complete, rather like writing down a
recipe. For example, say you wanted to instruct someone on how to make a peanut
butter-and-jelly sandwich. How would you go about this? After taking a second or
two to jot it down, you might start with something like this:
```
1. Put two slices of bread on a plate;
2. Spread peanut butter over one slice;
3. Spread jelly over the other slice;
4. Put the two slices together;
5. Done.
```

This recipe is fine for pretty much anyone; if anything, it might even be too
detailed. But what if you had to write the recipe for an alien? Even assuming
the alien knew what "bread", "slices", "peanut butter", "jelly", and "plates"
are, it would still be left with many questions, like:
- Where do I get the bread, plate, peanut butter, and jelly?
- How much of the peanut butter and jelly should I use?
- How do I spread them over the slices of bread?
- What sides of the slices of bread should I use for this?
- How should I put the slices together at the end?
- What should I do if the bread isn't pre-sliced or I can't open the jars of
  peanut butter and jelly?

The key point to remember is that computers (playing the role of the alien here)
are very dumb, and can only accomplish complicated tasks through explicit,
detailed instruction. When writing a program, you should always keep in mind
that the computer running your program knows nothing except for what you tell it
and a base set of rules that come with the language.

Additionally, some programming languages require the computer to look over a
complete set of instructions (that is, the entire program) before actually
deciding what to do, but Python does not. Whereas one of these other languages
may for some reason be able to see, like you or I might, that the order in which
steps (2) and (3) in the PB&J recipe doesn't matter, Python will not. Instead,
it forces the computer to look at each line of the program and execute it
one-by-one. This means that the general structure of a program written in Python
should look broadly like this one, which implements a well-known algorithm for
finding all the prime numbers less than some number `N`:
```python
# define basic names and terms for the program at the top of the program.
# by default, Python doesn't know what square roots are, so we have to define it
# here using someone else's code
from math import sqrt

# we want this to find all the prime numbers that are less than or equal to N.
# we'll do this by looking at each number less than or equal to N and checking
# to see if it's divisible by any other number in the list. Any number that is
# not divisible by any other number in this list is prime.
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(N):

    # start with a list of all integers in the range [2, N + 1)
    candidates = [n for n in range(2, N + 1)]

    # do the following for each of the candidate numbers
    for n in candidates:

        # we don't need to check any numbers greater than âˆšN
        if n > sqrt(N):
            break

        # we also don't need to check any numbers we've already eliminated
        if n == -1:
            continue

        # set all of n's multiples equal to -1
        for j in range(n**2 + n - 2, N - 1, n):
            candidates[j] = -1

    # any remaining numbers not equal to -1 is prime!
    primes = [n for n in candidates if n != -1]
    return primes

# print all primes up to 100
print(sieve_of_eratosthenes(100))
```

Don't worry about understanding all of this right away. We'll break it down in
the following sections while we go through some of the basic building blocks of
the Python language.

## 1. Variables and data types
Nearly all programming languages differentiate between types of data. Different
languages have different standards for how its types are dealt with (Python is
particularly flexible in this regard), but they all require the programmer to
think about, for instance, the difference between the number `12` and the letter
`'a'`. This is partly to help the computer manage all the bits and bytes that make
up a program while it's running, and partly because some operations simply don't
make sense for some types. (What would it mean to compute the sum `12 + 'a'`?)

### Numbers
The first type that we'll deal with is the **number**. In Python, "number"
actually comprises four data types that can all mutually interact through
standard arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*` `/`).

#### `int`
`int`s are how Python represents integer numbers (that is, all the whole numbers
from minus infinity to positive infinity). `int`s can add to, subtract from, and
multiply each other, but there's a bit of fine print when it comes to division.
In general, the division of two integers will not itself be another integer
(consider the operation `5 / 2`), so Python actually has two kinds of division,
denoted by `//` and `/`. The first kind is what you should use when you want to
divide two `int`s and get another `int` out: it computes the full division and
discards any non-integer remainder (`5 // 2` equals `2`). The second kind is
what you should use if you want the full answer as floating-point number, which
brings us to...

#### `float`
`float`s represent floating-point numbers, or numbers that may have a
non-integer part. `float`s can interact with all other numbers in the way you'd
normally expect, but can be written in two different but functionally equivalent
ways. The first is the standard way, e.g. `250.734`, and the second is with
scientific notation, e.g. `2.50734e2` as shorthand for 2.50734 \* 10^2.

#### `complex`
`complex`s are actually two `float`s bundled together to represent the real and
imaginary parts of a single complex number. To use a `complex`, you can write it
using `j` notation, e.g. `1.5 + 0.4j`, `-2.6 + 1e6j`. When two complex numbers
are added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided together, the imaginary components
obey the usual rules, i.e. `1j * 1j` is equal to `-1`.

#### `bool`
`bool`s (short for Boolean values) represent truth values for logical
expressions, and can be either `True` or `False`.
