# The Basics of Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language known for its
flexibility and wide applicability in addition to its accessibility to new
programmers. This is a short description of some key features of Python as they
relate to this project. It is hardly comprehensive, however; if you'd like to
learn more about this language and how to use it, I suggest taking a look at the
[official beginner's guide][1] or this [series of recorded lectures from an MIT
course][2].
